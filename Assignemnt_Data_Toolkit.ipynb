        "#21.Why is NumPy’s array slicing faster than Python's list slicing?\n",
        "Ans:NumPy’s array slicing is faster than Python’s list slicing because of the way NumPy arrays are stored in memory and how operations are implemented at a low level. Let’s break it down:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Contiguous Memory Storage\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory, meaning all elements are laid out sequentially.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python lists are arrays of pointers to objects, where each element can be scattered in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Effect:\n",
        "\n",
        "Accessing a slice of a NumPy array is just computing offsets in memory, which is extremely fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "Slicing a Python list requires traversing pointers and copying references, which adds overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Views vs Copies\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy slicing returns a view, not a copy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modifying the slice modifies the original array.\n",
        "\n",
        "No new memory is allocated; only metadata (shape, strides, start index) is updated.\n",
        "\n",
        "import numpy as np\n",
        "\n",
        "arr = np.arange(1000)\n",
        "slice_arr = arr[100:200]  # This is a view, not a copy\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "NumPy avoids the costly copy operation, making slicing much faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Low-level Implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy is implemented in C and optimized for numerical computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Slicing, indexing, and arithmetic operations are vectorized, avoiding Python’s per-element overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python lists operate in pure Python, so every slice involves Python-level operations and function calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Vectorized Operations\n",
        "\n",
        "Because NumPy slices are views, you can perform operations on the slice directly, which executes in compiled C code, rather than iterating element by element in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "slice_arr *= 2  # Fast vectorized operation\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
